# Development Backlog Document

## PackageName

```python
src
```

## UX

- N/A - The design document focuses on backend services and their interactions. UI design will be handled by a separate team in accordance with the backend APIs.

## TaskList

- ['src/main.py', 'The entry point for the application. It should initialize the Flask app and include routes to all backend services.']
- ['src/config/config.yaml', 'Contains the configuration for the application. This includes database connection strings, service endpoints, authentication secrets, etc.']
- ['src/config/config.py', 'Contains a singleton Config class that loads the config.yaml file for easy access throughout the application. This class will be used by all services to retrieve configuration settings.']
- ['src/user_service.py', 'Implements the UserService class with methods createUser() and authenticateUser(). It should interact with the Database_Users to persist user data.']
- ['src/order_service.py', 'Implements the OrderService class with methods createOrder() and cancelOrder(). It should interact with the Database_Orders to manage order data.']
- ['src/inventory_service.py', 'Implements the InventoryService class with methods checkStock() and updateInventory(). It should interact with the Database_Inventory to manage inventory data.']
- ['src/authentication_service.py', 'Implements the AuthenticationService class to handle user authentication and token generation using JWT.']
- ['src/database_models.py', 'Defines the SQLAlchemy ORM models for User, Order, and Inventory based on the provided ER diagram.']
- ['src/tests/', 'Includes unit tests for each service and model to ensure functionality is working as expected.']

## ImplementationList

- UserService.createUser()
- UserService.authenticateUser()
- OrderService.createOrder()
- OrderService.cancelOrder()
- InventoryService.checkStock()
- InventoryService.updateInventory()
- AuthenticationService.authenticate()
- AuthenticationService.generate_token()

## RequiredPackages


Flask
SQLAlchemy
PyJWT


## DependenciesandTools

- ['Flask', 'To create the web application and API endpoints.']
- ['SQLAlchemy', 'For ORM database interactions.']
- ['PyJWT', 'To handle JWT based authentication.']

## Security

- Implement JWT based stateless authentication in RESTful APIs.
- Use Flask-HTTPAuth for HTTP authentication.
- Ensure secure storage of user passwords using hashing.

## TestCases

- Test UserService.createUser() with valid and invalid data.
- Test UserService.authenticateUser() with correct and incorrect credentials.
- Test OrderService.createOrder() with valid order data.
- Test OrderService.cancelOrder() for existing and non-existing orders.
- Test InventoryService.checkStock() for available and unavailable items.
- Test InventoryService.updateInventory() with valid and invalid stock changes.
