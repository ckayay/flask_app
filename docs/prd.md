# Requirements Document for Dynamic Form Creation and Data Collection Application

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to outline the functional and non-functional requirements for a web application that enables admin users to create advanced dynamic forms and allows users to fill them in, with the data being stored in a secure database.

## Assumptions

- The primary objective is to provide a platform for admin users to create customizable forms for data collection, which can then be filled out by end-users.
- The application will not require integration with existing systems at launch but should be designed to allow for potential integrations in the future.
- There are plans for future features or expansions post-launch, focusing on the core functionalities for the initial launch.

## FunctionalRequirements

- Admin users must be able to create, edit, and manage dynamic forms with various field types.
- End-users must be able to fill out and submit forms created by admin users.
- The application must securely store form submissions in a database.
- Admin users must have the ability to view and export collected data.
- The system must provide user authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## NonFunctionalRequirements

- The application will be designed with a modular architecture to facilitate scalability and maintainability.
- Performance will ensure quick response times under normal load conditions.
- Scalability will allow the system to handle an increasing number of form submissions and concurrent users.
- Reliability will include mechanisms for data backup and recovery.
- Availability will aim for 99.9% uptime, with minimal downtime for maintenance.
- Usability will focus on a user-friendly interface for both admin users and end-users.
- Security will include data encryption, secure API endpoints, and compliance with data protection regulations.
- Maintainability will involve clear code documentation and adherence to coding standards.
- Compatibility will ensure the application operates across different browsers and devices.
- Portability will allow the application to be moved to different environments if necessary.
- Internationalization and localization will be considered for future updates.
- Responsiveness will ensure the application adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
- Interoperability will allow for future integrations with other systems or APIs.
- Versioning will manage different versions of the application to ensure backward compatibility.
- Error Handling will include robust mechanisms with meaningful error messages.

## UserStories

- As an admin user, I want to create and customize forms so that I can collect the specific data I need.
- As an admin user, I want to edit existing forms so that I can update the fields as requirements change.
- As an admin user, I want to manage user submissions so that I can analyze the collected data effectively.
- As an end-user, I want to fill out forms so that I can provide the necessary information to the admin users.
- As an admin user, I want to have secure access to the application so that unauthorized users cannot tamper with the data.

## OutOfScope

Integration with existing systems is out of scope for the initial launch but may be considered for future updates.

## AnythingUnclear

Everything is clear.
